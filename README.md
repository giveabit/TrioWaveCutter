Help with cutting a re-record from the Digitech Trio+

v1.0 as of 2016-12-29

This tool helps you with cutting a wave-record from your Digitech Trio+ pedal for further usage in your DAW:

simply record the audio signals from your Trio Plus to a wave recorder (or mp3 recorder and convert this to wave).

you have to turn up only the volume knob for ONE INSTRUMENT AT A TIME and leave a pause of minimum 3 seconds at the beginning of the recording and a minimum of 2 seconds between two instruments while recording.

you end up with a large wave file that contains all your recorded instruments part by part. this tool will split up in the single instruments that you recorded and rename the files.

thus you should be easily able to make further fun with this audio files in the DAW of your choice!

Cheers!

P.S.: Again this is all python script code so go and get python for your computer, if you haven't already!
P.P.S: Sampe recording included for your convenience and better understandig what this is all about!
